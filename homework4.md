Formal Methods:
Formal methods can be part of the solution if imprecise designs and implementations that deviate from product specifications or design intentions are the causes for faults. Formal methods can prevent injection of certain defects into the software system.
Formal methods cannot guarantee perfection for software, but only assure it with respect to the formal specifications verified or the properties checked. In general, formal methods are suitable to stable product development and market environments, where product requirements can be captured into formal specifications and remain fairly stable thereafter to allow for later refinements and verifications.

Model checking:
Model checking is one of the approaches to do formal verification. It is a technique for automatically verifying correctness properties of finite-state systems. Specifications about the system are expressed as temporal logic formulas, and efficient symbolic algorithms are used to traverse the model defined by the system and check if the specification holds or not. Extremely large state-spaces can often be traversed in minutes. The technique has been applied to several complex industrial systems.
