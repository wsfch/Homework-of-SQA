Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives.

Inspection vs. preventive actions:
Inspection coupled with causal analysis
Together drive preventive actions
Key difference: error vs fault focus

Inspection vs. formal verification
FV (cid:25) formalized inspection
Focus: people vs. mathematical/logical
Tradeoff: formality vs. cost
Training and acceptability issues

Inspection vs. testing
Existence of the implemented product
Levels of quality/defects
Static vs. dynamic defects
Localized vs. interconnected defects
Combined approaches:1) phases and transitions 2) inspection of testing entities/processes

Inspection vs. fault tolerance
Complementary instead of competing
Static vs. dynamic
Inspection of FT techniques/mechanisms
