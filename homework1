My understanding of software quality assurance

I think that SQA consists of many many methods of monitoring the software engineering processes which are used to ensure the software’s quality.

SQA is not only testing. Actually I am doing an intern job in a QA team. And SQA encompasses the entire software development process including requirements definition, software design, coding, source code control, code review, software configuration management, testing, releasing and so on. In every phase of software process there have some method to make sure everything works in the best way. And these methods are SQA’s main content. For example, in the requirements phase, we must make sure that the requirements are clear and reasonable, otherwise we may spend lots of time but can’t get the pays because customers may say this is not what they want .
